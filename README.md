# co2 emission app
Preliminary assignment for Reaktor summer job application.
My first web app project after Helsinki university full stack course.
I started this project January 13. 2019, and used as much time as I could between family, fulltime work and Helsinki university Ohjelmoinnin MOOC 2019 -course.

react, node 

frontend working @ https://muikkuco2.herokuapp.com/
api @ https://muikkuco2api.herokuapp.com/

todo:

start using google charts, refactor transformer.js for that

make charts work properly when giving bad year, pie chart year 1960 not working properly, so is any year?

change labels more consistent
